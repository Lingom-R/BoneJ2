# BoneJ2
BoneJ2 - the next gen version of BoneJ for ImageJ2 in development

The `Legacy` module contains the "mavenized" versions of the plugins in BoneJ1. Eventually they'll be reimplemented for ImageJ2 in `Modern`, and removed from `Legacy`. Another goal of ours is to migrate generally useful functionality to `image-common`, `imglib2` or other such core library.

See the wiki for more information about the project.
